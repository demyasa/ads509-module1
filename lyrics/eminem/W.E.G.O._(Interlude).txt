"W.E.G.O. (Interlude)"



Yeah, soul intent, checking in number one, baby this week
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is MC Proof and DJ Head!

Checkin' in on W.E.G.O.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ay, yo, we got the number-one requested song (alright) of the day coming up next
It's a local 313 talent
He goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called "It's OK"
